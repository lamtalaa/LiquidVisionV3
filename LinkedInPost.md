🧠 LiquidVision — "Seeing, Hearing, and Understanding On‑Device"

🚀 The Challenge
LiquidVision started as an image-classification + sentiment mashup. The newest sprint asked: can the same app listen in real time, surface ambient sound insights, and stay 100% on device? Bonus goals: write a traceable analysis log, harden error handling, and drive coverage past 60% without bloating the architecture.

🔧 What I Shipped
• Audio Analyzer tab that lets you import an audio file or stream the mic, transcribes speech with on-device SFSpeechRecognizer, and classifies ambient audio via SoundAnalysis’ built-in models.
• Glassmorphism UI that mirrors the Vision/Sentiment tabs, complete with rich live buttons (start glows green, stop pulses red) and realtime confidence bars.
• Actor-backed logger that persists each session to `analysis_log.json` (documents directory by default, override-able via env var during dev) so QA/support can replay a prediction trail.
• Unit coverage boost: new suites exercise the logger, audio analyzer view model edge cases (permission denials, logging behavior), file analysis, and coordinator registry while keeping tests async-safe.

📚 What I Learned
• SoundAnalysis’ live stream wants frame-consistent sample positions—tracking `AVAudioFramePosition` per buffer eliminated flaky classifications.
• Keeping the logger sandbox-friendly yet developer-friendly meant honoring iOS’ container rules but offering an environment override for quick exports.
• UI consistency matters: lifting the glass card and gradient language from the original tabs made the new feature feel native instead of bolted on.

🧰 Tech Stack & Architecture
SwiftUI + MVVM + lightweight coordinators, powered by:
• Core ML (MobileNetV2) + Vision for image inference
• Apple Natural Language for sentiment scoring
• AVFoundation + Speech + SoundAnalysis for audio capture/transcription/classification
• JSON logging via an async actor to keep file writes safe under Swift Concurrency

🎬 Visual Snippet
Imagine a glassy Audio tab: the audio source badge flips to “Live”, the green button records, a transcript fills in line-by-line, and the Top Predictions card streams "applause • 92%", "speech • 74%", "keyboard • 41%" in real time. Stopping the session turns the control red and drops a fresh log entry.

💭 Reflection
This release reinforced that expanding scope doesn’t have to mean expanding complexity. By leaning on the existing coordinator registry and view-state patterns, the audio stack slotted in cleanly—and the test suite now has the receipts.
